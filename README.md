# DNA Sequencing with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to DNA sequencing data. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to preprocess DNA sequences, extract meaningful features, and build predictive models to classify or analyze genetic information.



## Introduction
DNA sequencing involves determining the precise order of nucleotides within a DNA molecule. With advancements in machine learning, it is possible to analyze these sequences to predict various genetic traits, identify mutations, or even diagnose diseases.

This notebook focuses on using machine learning models to process and analyze DNA sequencing data, with the goal of building a predictive model that can be used for various genomic studies.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of DNA sequences labeled with their respective classes or outcomes. The sequences can be obtained from public genomic databases such as NCBI, ENA, or others. 


## Preprocessing
The preprocessing section includes:
- Converting DNA sequences into a machine-readable format.
- Cleaning the data to remove any noise or irrelevant information.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Feature Extraction
In this section, we explore different methods of feature extraction from DNA sequences:
- **K-mer counting:** Breaking down sequences into subsequences of length 'k' and counting their occurrences.
- **One-hot encoding:** Representing DNA sequences as binary vectors.
- **Sequence alignment:** Aligning sequences to find regions of similarity that may indicate functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships.

## Model Building
This section covers the process of building and evaluating machine learning models using the extracted features:
- **Model Selection:** Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, SVM, Neural Networks) for DNA sequence classification.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Adjusting model parameters to optimize performance.
- **Model Evaluation:** Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.

## Results
The results section summarizes the performance of the machine learning models, including:
- Model accuracy on the test dataset.
- Comparison of different models.
- Visualization of results (e.g., ROC curves, confusion matrices).
