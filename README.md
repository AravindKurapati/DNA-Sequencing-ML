# DNA Sequence Analysis Using Machine Learning
In this project, I explored DNA sequence analysis using a combination of machine learning and data visualization techniques. Below is a summary of the key components and accomplishments:

## Data Preprocessing
Transformed raw DNA sequences into a machine-readable format using k-mers for feature extraction.
Engineered meaningful features such as GC content to enhance the model's ability to capture genetic information.

##Feature Engineering and Model Training
Trained various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, SVM, and Naive Bayes, using different k-mer sizes to optimize performance.
Applied deep learning by training LSTM models to capture sequential dependencies and improve classification accuracy.

##Visualization and Insights
Visualized nucleotide distributions and analyzed sequence length variability across human, chimpanzee, and dog DNA datasets.
Conducted pairwise sequence similarity analysis using Jaccard similarity and developed alignment heatmaps to highlight critical regions of genetic similarity.

## Advanced Comparative Analysis
Performed sequence alignment between human, chimpanzee, and dog DNA, identifying conserved genetic regions across species.
Leveraged advanced scoring metrics such as BLOSUM62 to conduct biologically meaningful comparisons, offering deeper insights into evolutionary relationships.

## Key Findings
Optimal k-mer size: K=6 struck the best balance between computational efficiency and model performance.

Model performance: Logistic Regression and SVM models excelled in classification tasks, demonstrating strong predictive power.

Deep learning potential: LSTM models effectively captured temporal patterns in DNA sequences, showcasing their applicability to biological sequence data.

Evolutionary insights: Sequence alignment and similarity analysis revealed significant evolutionary relationships among species.

This project highlights the power of combining traditional machine learning, deep learning, and advanced data visualization techniques to derive meaningful insights from biological data.
